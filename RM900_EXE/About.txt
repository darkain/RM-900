WinAmp KeyLog Version 1.0

This program was designed to work with the Live!Drive Ir Remotes (RM-900) that comes with the Creatve Sound Blaster Live! Platinum 5.1 series sound cards.  What this means is that when you press a button on your remote, it'll preform that function within WinAmp.  Heres how it works.
