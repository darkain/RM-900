Winamp RM-900 Plug-In v1.0

1) Introduction
This Plug-In was designed to work with the RM-900 Ir remote
that comes with the Creatice Sound Blaster Live! Platinum
5.1's Live!Drive Ir.  Before running this program, please
verify that 'ThunderRT5Form.KEY' was placed in the correct
folder.  By default it is placed in the

If this isn't the folder for your RemoteCenter key map files,
then please place it in the correct folder.  Next, run Winamp.
Once Winamp is loaded, press 'Start' a few times on the remote
until the 'Select Aplication to Control' window pops up.
Scroll downand and select 'Winamp RM900 Plug-In.'  From there
your good to go.  You now have full control over Winamp via
the remote control.  ENJOY !!
