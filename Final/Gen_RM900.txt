-=- 1 -=- Introduction
This Plug-In was designed to work with the RM-900 Ir remote
that comes with the Creatice Sound Blaster Live! Platinum
5.1's Live!Drive Ir.  Before running this plug-in, please
verify that 'ThunderRT5Form.KEY' was placed in the correct
folder.  By default it is placed in the
'C:\Program Files\Creative\RemoteCenter\Rc\KeyMap\' folder.
(new in v1.1 - try to locate the correct folder on its own.)
If this isn't the folder for your RemoteCenter key map files,
then please place it in the correct folder.  Next, run Winamp.
Once Winamp is loaded, press 'Start' a few times on the remote
until the 'Select Aplication to Control' window pops up.
Scroll downand and select 'Winamp RM900 Plug-In.'  From there
your good to go.  You now have full control over Winamp via
the remote control.  ENJOY !!

should be enough for now.



-=- 3 -=- Updates and notes
V1.0 - First release.  Really just a beta.  It had many problems.

V1.1 - Fixed all of the problems I knew about at the time.  This
       included the ability to search for Remote Center so that
       all files will be placed in the correct folderz.  Excellent!

V1.2 - Only 1 change in this version, it has the Win2K fix.  I also
       added a web site from where you can download the latest
       version - www.darkain.com

V1.3 - This is the best yet!  A new feature, you no longer have to
       select the plug-in with the remote's active aplication menu.
       This new feature is still a bit buggu because Creative's
       software does not like being taken over.  I still recomend
       sellecting the plug-in from the list.

V1.4 - Better then then the best yet!  This new feature now works
       all the time!  It is great, what can I say?  It saves all of
       the hastles of selecting the plug-in from those annoying
       menus.  If you plan on ever upgrading or re-installing
       RemoteCenter in the future, you may need to re-install this
       plug-in for it to work correctly.
